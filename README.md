<title>HTML suffering<\title>

-  Hi, I'm Haiden. I'd rather not put my full name into my username.
  
- About me: A student at USW going through the trials and tribulations of University, whilst also having the degree I'm meant to be working on. No clue what my end goal for the degree is, so long as it's not being tech support/IT team in the basement.
  
- What I am doing: Currently completing a Bsc in Computer Science. Writing this README. Trying to remember the HTML I wrote about a year ago now.
  
- Skillset: I have experience with Python, C++, Java and HTML, and will aim to expand this skillset in the future.

- Recent Projects Completed:
- In lessons, I have been creating an ERD that will be implemented into an SQL database for a sports club. 
- Made a website a while back in college for a fake computer company, where I learnt the perils of HTML.

- Future projects I'd like to get started on (and complete):
- Some sort of game, most likely based off of a pre-existing title.
- Game Modding - I have some ideas for what I'd like to make, and realistically this is a better place to start than a full game, but I would need to figure out if it would actually be possible first, given that some games have their limits
- Raspberry Pi-based projects: I have a Pi collecting dust in my drawers. I have no idea what to do with it. Security system for the uni flat perhaps? We get a lot of people going in and out. Buy a tiny screen for it at least, it already comes in a keyboard shell.


- Hobbies: There's plenty of things I've struggled with committing to, like drawing and video editing. I enjoy cycling, but should really do it more. Enjoy playing D&D and derailing the story if possible. I play too many videogames, and I am capable of sitting down and watching a film without subway surfers in the corner.

- Coding advice/nightmares: Creating a button in HTML is far more difficult than it really needs to be. Greenfoot is a terrible way to make a game and I'd advise staying far away from it. Check your variable names and ;'s before you go searching online. Have you tried saving your work, then turning it off and on again?
