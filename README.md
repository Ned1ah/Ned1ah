<h1><u>The section about myself</u></h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Haiden. Some of this information will be removed once this is marked.
<br>
<br>
<br>
About me: A student at USW going through the trials and tribulations of University life, whilst also having a Computer Science Bsc degree to be working on.
 I'm undecided on what my end goal is once I'm done with that, so I'm looking to try many different aspects of computer science and find
 the one thing that I'm really passionate about. I have a general interest in software development, and specifically games development, with
 a desire to know more about how such software is created, but I don't know if that's realistic as a career path.
 <br>
 <br>
What Am I doing: Outside of that, I'm trying to branch out and find some interests that I can spend my spare time being passionate about, as covid and general 
social issues have restricted that. Ideally something that doesn't require a screen.
 <br>
 <br>
 Skillset: I have experience with varying languages, and Python, C++, Java and HTML, and will aim to expand this skillset in the future.
 <br>
 <br>
 - Python: The first language I learnt, I have used it as a starting point to learn the basic fundamentals of programming. It has been used for simple programs, and I will aim to write
up some scripts in the future for handling otherwise tedious tasks. ->> this goes in projects such as a program that
 read in the results of a game to a text file, utilising data validation to minimise the possibility of incorrect data being read to the storage file. The user had to input their player id, 
 and number of games played, so that the program could loop to take input for the score and time taken for each game played.  After this, the average time and best score were calculated and stored in the text file.

 <br>
 - C++: I have been learning this languange during my time at USW, and have created many short programs to learn about the different important elements of C++, like functions and looping.
 Although I started out a bit confused by it, I got past that quite quickly and am now enjoying using it, perhaps even more than python!

 <br>
 -HTML: Although I am nowhere near an expert on it, I have some experience with it due to having to create a website in college, and opting to create it with HTML, rather than
 resorting to a website builder. Hopefully this page will be tidier than that project though.

<br>
-Java:  I have a small amount of experience with Java as it was used in BlueJay to teach us about object-oriented programming in college, but I didn't enjoy using it much. I 
may try and re-learn the language, as I recognise what it is capable of if you stick with it.
