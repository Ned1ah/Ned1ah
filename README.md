<h1><u>The section about myself</u></h1>
<p class="dotted">Hi , Hiya, Heya, or Yo, I'm @Ned1ah (Haiden. Not very creative username, I know). Some of this information will be removed once this is marked.
<br>
<br>
<br>
About me: A student at USW going through the trials and tribulations of University life, whilst also having a Computer Science Bsc degree to be working on.
 I'm undecided on what my end goal is once I'm done with that, so I'm looking to try many different aspects of computer science and find
 the one thing that I'm really passionate about. I have a general interest in software development, and specifically games development, with
 a desire to know more about how such software is created, but I don't know if that's realistic as a career path.
 <br>
 <br>
What Am I doing: Outside of that, I'm trying to branch out and find some interests that I can spend my spare time being passionate about, as covid and general 
social issues have restricted that. Ideally something that doesn't require a screen.
 <br>
 <br>
 Skillset: I have experience with varying languages, and Python, C++, Java and HTML, and will aim to expand this skillset in the future.
 <br>
 <br>
 - Python: The first language I learnt, I have used it as a starting point to learn the basic fundamentals of programming. It has been used for simple programs, and I will aim to write
up some scripts in the future for handling otherwise tedious tasks.
 <br>
  <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Python-logo-notext.svg" alt "PythonLogo" style="width:100px;height:100px;">
 <br>
 - C++: I have been learning this languange during my time at USW, and have created many short programs to learn about the different important elements of C++, like functions and looping.
 Although I started out a bit confused by it, I got past that quite quickly and am now enjoying using it, perhaps even more than python!

 <br>
 -HTML: Although I am nowhere near an expert on it, I have some experience with it due to having to create a website in college, and opting to create it with HTML, rather than
 resorting to a website builder. Hopefully this page will be tidier than that project though.

<br>
-Java:  I have a small amount of experience with Java as it was used in BlueJay to teach us about object-oriented programming in college, but I didn't enjoy using it much. I 
may try and re-learn the language, as I recognise what it is capable of if you stick with it, namely creating applications.

  <br>
  <br>
  Personal Interests: I have various interests not related to what I study, but I struggle to find the time and motivation to commit to most of them.
<br>
<br>
  - Video editing/creation: I only have a few properly structed videos made, and I have struggled to both find ideas that I want to make, as well as making the time
  to actually edit a video together. When everything lines up though, I do find the processes of script writing and editing quite satisfying and rewarding, 
  although the sound of my own voice is something I'm really not used to.
  <br>
  <br>
  - Drawing: I have always had at least some interest in drawing, but I've not found the time or motivation to start properly practising it.
  <br>
<br>
  - Films and TV: I try to be more critical with the media that I consume, but that's not always appropriate, and I can enjoy a film for what it is if it's apparent
  that there isn't anything to look too deeply into. I particarly enjoy sci-fi and animation, though.
  <br>
<br>
  - Video games: Something that I've always been interested in, I have a particular appreciation for older titles and, where possible and practical, will try and
  play on their original hardware, although emulation is a fine way to play as well.

<h2><u>What Projects have I completed?</u></h2>
<p class="dotted">
<br>
<br>
Some examples of programs created for college and university are shown here. Any independent or group projects completed will be displayed here also.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<u>Python</u>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 High score and Average time: A program that read in the player name, best score and average time of a game to a text file, 
 utilising data validation to minimise the possibility 
 of incorrect data being read to the storage file. The user had to input their player id and then number of games played,
 so that the program could loop to take input for the score and time taken for each game played. 
 After this, the average time and best score were calculated and then stored in the text file.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<u>C++</u>
<br>
<br>
<br>
TinsOfPaint: A program that uses basic maths to calculate the tins of paint required to paint a fence, which is found by dividing the total area of fence by the area
covered by one paint tin, which leads to the total number of tins. std::setprecision() was used to remove the decimal, as only a whole number of tins is useful information.
<br>
<br>
projecthours: A program that calculates the total hours and minutes worked by two people, which uses the minutes worked each day 
multiplied the inputted number of days to determine the total time worked.
<br>
<br>
triangle: A program to calculate the area of a triangle, taking user input and then calculating an area with it.
In addition to this, there is some data validation used, by checking if the sides are valid with specific sums.
If the sides are determined to be invalid, then the program exits and returns an error message.
<br>
<br>
distance: A program utilising a while loop, it takes the speed a vehicle is travelling at, and how many
 hours the vehicle is travelling, and then using these values, it loops to output the total miles travelled 
 at each hour, stopping the loop once an increment has been met.
 <br>
 <br>
 averagespeed: A program that utilises functions to calculate the average speed met during a journey between 3 points.
 It takes two measurements of distance and time between point X and Y, then Y and Z, and inputs them into 
 a function, which returns the average speed in Km/H by dividing the total distance by the total time.
 <br>
 <br>
 <u>HTML</u>
 <br>
 <br>
 College Website: As part of the web devlopment unit, I had to create a website, where we did have the option to use a website builder, as the focus was more so on the website design,
 but I opted to challenge myself with HTML, which ended up being an interesting learning experience. My website included a header of different pages made using a table, 
 local images, and buttons leading to external websites.
 <br>
 <br>
 <u>SQL</u>
 <br>
 <br>
 Football database: For a uni task, I created a database using Oracle Apex, that stores information regarding a football club, with tables such as teams, players, matches and support staff.
 I had to first create an ERD to identify not only the tables I would need to create, but also what connections would need to be made, identifying many-to-many relationships
 and adding in intermediary tables. After completing the ERD and explaining each relationship, I then had to create data for the database and then implement it into some newly created
 tables, which meant researching some excel formulas to ease the process of data creation. Once the tables were implemented, I made some SQL queries and was then finished with the project.
 
 <br>
 <br>
 <u>Projects I would like to start</u>
 <br>
 <br>
 - Raspberry Pi-based project: I have a pi gathering dust in one of my drawers, and I would like to put it to use at some point. A security system for the accom flat perhaps? 
 (assuming it doesn't violate the contract).
 - Game modding/Game creation: Modding is the more likely outcome of the two, as getting into game mods can be a good stepping stone to more original projects, or creating an entirely 
 new experience using the base of a pre-existing title.
